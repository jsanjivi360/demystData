# Problem 1

I have written the code in Python. The 3 files under CodeFiles can be downloaded into the same directory of a UNIX system. Change directory to the files' path, and trigger the code using the below command:

python main.py

If you are using python3, then:

python3 main.py

The input and output files will be generated under the problem_1 directory. 

# Problem 2

I have written the code in an Apache Spark environment using Python. The 4 files under CodeFiles can be downloaded into the same directory of a UNIX system. 

faker Python library will need to be installed for generating the sample data.

Change directory to the code files' path, and trigger the code using the below command:

python main.py

If you are using python3, then:

python3 main.py

The input and output files will be generated under the same current directory.
